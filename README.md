Become a cripple, use a WheelChair...

*** I reccomend you use the original wheelchair (hrt)

# Gold Standard WheelChair
Remove all exisiting scripts. Wheelchair is now a chromium based extension that will stop you from having to reinstall scripts.

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Enable developer mode (probably a checkbox in the top right)
3. [Download this unpacked extension](https://github.com/hrt/WheelChair/releases/download/2.0/loader.zip)
4. Drag the downloaded zip into the extensions page



If you can figure out reliable ways to identify the presence of this script running then I am interested to know.
